A Pipeline for pneumonia Detection from Chest Images Using Machine Learning
# Introduction
Diagnosis of pneumonia and COVID-19 from medical images is challenging as it relies on the expertise of trained radiologist. This method is prone to incorrect interpretation of results resulting in mis-diagnosis. An alternative way of diagnosing is through the use of trained machine learning models and this methos have previously shown a success in diagnosing pneumonia using chest images. Further incorporating these models in a portable mobile applicatiom can result in quick and improved diagnosis of these diseases.
# Objective
To create a mobile application that can assist radiologists in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 from medical images
